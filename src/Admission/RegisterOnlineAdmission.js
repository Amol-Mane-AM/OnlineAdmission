                        The School conducts Entrance Assessment to determine the right placement of an applicant. The assessment of a student will be determined by the admission committee and is necessary to complete the registration process. Once this step has been completed, a student may be offered either a seat, placed on the waitlist or denied.

                        Educators recognize that there is a wide range of behaviour and performance within any grade or year. The admission process includes academic and developmental assessments to identify those students most likely to benefit from our program. We understand that children have different learning needs & challenges, and our teachers are qualified to help each child succeed through differentiation of instruction, assessment and attention to the learning styles of students.</p>
